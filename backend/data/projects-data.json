Designed to bridge a gap where one could buy an airline ticket or a digital voucher for a group buy deal site even if one doesn't have a bank credit/debit card. 7-Eleven and 7-Connect bridged that gap by pioneering a service allowing customers to purchase online and pay at any 7-Eleven store with cash.

It now has been extended to accept bank deposits with real-time crediting. This service now processes over 17 Billion Pesos a month and growing rapidly, a significant milestone that started as an idea only seven years ago. </p> <p> 7-CONNECT is also the platform for 7-Eleven CliQQ Reward and CliQQ Wallet, allowing real-time redemption of rewards and making cashless payment at 7-Eleven stores.</p> <p> 7-CONNECT features the following: </p> <p><ul><li>24/7 secure cash payment at all 7-Eleven stores</li><li>Real-time posting at bank/e-wallet/merchant accounts</li><li>Easier and faster than bank deposits</li><li>Solution for those without bank accounts or credit/debit cards</li><li>Alternative payment for those hesitant to use bank accounts online</li><li>Zero risks of fraud and chargebacks</li><li>Real-time notification of payment</li></ul></p>"
