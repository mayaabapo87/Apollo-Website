        "details": "7-CONNECT, a 7-Eleven branding of Apollo Technologies PAYCONNECT service, is a platform that is owned and operated by Apollo Technologies. PAYCONNECT is a bank-grade payment switch built as a payment gateway system that leverages an \"offline to online\" model. It recognizes that many Filipinos are unbanked and may not have access to sophisticated smartphones (well at least in 2012). Designed to bridge a gap where one could buy an airline ticket or a digital voucher for a \"group buy\" deal site even if one doesn't have a bank credit/debit card. 7-Eleven and 7-Connect bridged that gap by pioneering a service allowing customers to purchase online and pay at any 7-Eleven store with cash. The digital product is sent electronically as payment is made in real-time similar to credit cards.\n\nThe pioneering service eventually revolutionized how bills and e-commerce can be simplified for those using cash as the process was made simpler with the introduction of kiosks, mobile app, and mobile app integration. Customers can pay for online purchases, topping up e-wallets, or do anything online and pay at a 7-Eleven store using a simple barcode generated through the 7-CONNECT system. It now has been extended to accept bank deposits with real-time crediting. This service now processes over 17 Billion Pesos a month and growing rapidly, a significant milestone that started as an idea only seven years ago.\n\n7-CONNECT is also the platform for 7-Eleven CliQQ Reward and CliQQ Wallet, allowing real-time redemption of rewards and making cashless payment at 7-Eleven stores.\n\n7-CONNECT features the following:\n<ul>\n<li>24/7 secure cash payment at all 7-Eleven stores</li>\n<li>Real-time posting at bank/e-wallet/merchant accounts</li>\n<li>Easier and faster than bank deposits</li>\n<li>Solution for those without bank accounts or credit/debit cards</li>\n<li>Alternative payment for those hesitant to use bank accounts online</li>\n<li>Zero risks of fraud and chargebacks</li>\n<li>Real-time notification of payment</li>\n</ul>"
