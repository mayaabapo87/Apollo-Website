                                    open-source technologies, and the extensive use of Internet technology to build innovative Information 
                                    and Communication Technology (ICT) solutions. It aligned the seismic technological changes at that time 
                                    (the Web browser, Internet technologies, the emergence of open-source software) with its vision of 
                                    empowering change in the emerging market through creation of innovative Information and Communication 
                                    Technology solutions. </p>

                                    global standards and open-source software, it would facilitate the transformative power of ICT to aid Philippine

                                    “software as a service” way back in 2002 when it wasnt a buzzword yet. The world was still on licensed software 
                                    and locked in vendor-based proprietary technologies. By building a strong engineering culture, the company built 
                                    solutions for both large and small companies. It offered a “subscription type, pay-per-use” model allowing easy 
                                    adoption by its targeted clients with a low-cost usage model. The trailblazing effort paved the way to a business
                                    model that enables the company to partner with companies /Government institutions and offer its software technology
                                    andengineering expertise to build innovative ICT solutions geared for the emerging market. </p>
